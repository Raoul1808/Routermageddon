# Routermageddon
 **A very stupid mod that triggers events when you place router chains.**
 
 DISCLAIMER: This mod only works on a wave-based map.
 
## Router chain events
 Here is a list of all the router chain events implemented:
 
- Spawn 100 Antumbra enemies on each spawn point on the map
- Remove all power sources and nodes from the map
- Remove all turrets from the map
- Removes the routers you placed
- Explodes like a thorium reactor would
- Changes your game language to French *(effective after a restart)*
- Spawns a ring of bullets with random velocities that can damage you and your buildings
- *possibbly more to come...*

## But why?
 idk
